        <h1>Executive summary</h1>
        <p>
            Passed week I have been working on repairing eight more electronic 
            devices and generated for business ~5 000 rubles and much more for 
            our clients including securing investments in organic assets which 
            heavily rely on stable work of electronics which had got broken. <br><br>

            This publication shares some interesting things about how to fix 
            your car's sound amplifier and TV at your home. 
        </p>
        <h1>Cases</h1>

            <h2>Sounds amplifier</h2>
            <p>
                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <p>
                    <!-- put image here -->
                    By changing amplitude and frequency of an electrical signal 
                    transmitter encode a sound into a plain electrical signal 
                    which is recognized and decoded back to the sound by a 
                    receiver. <br><br>
                    
                    What sounds amplifier does is increase a power of this 
                    electrical signal. Often transformers are used to increase 
                    a power of an electrical signal as it was <a href="https://gelassen.github.io/blog/2023/12/23/electronics-tech-notes-part-1-getting-started.html">described here</a>, 
                    but they create a lot of noise which drastically impact a 
                    sound wave, so something else should be used. <br><br>

                    Transmitters are used for this aim. They also increase a 
                    power of an electricity, but don't have such drawbacks as 
                    transformers. This circuit has several powerful ones which 
                    are served for this aim and has a lot of smaller ones which 
                    intention is not fully clear for me (likely they are used 
                    for setting up base voltage for the rest of the circuit). <br><br>
                    
                    This sound amplifier supports four audio dynamics, this 
                    circuit has many symmetrical elements to do the same work 
                    for each of four dynamics. 
                </p>
                <h3>An instrument to simplify diagnostics</h3>
                <p>
                    Diagnostics of such circuit could be complicated as there 
                    are ~100 elements, most of them could be in one of three 
                    states in the normal mode. In this context you have to check 
                    abnormal voltage drops one each segment of this circuit. <br><br>
                    
                    Fortunately there is another way suggested by my colleague. <br><br>

                    The electrical signal in circuit carrier a sound. It means 
                    connecting something which is able to decode an electrical 
                    signal back to the sound will help up distinguish by ear a 
                    sound from a noise. <br><br>

                    The instrument is old cheap headphones and a probe 
                    connected together over capacitors (0.5 mF or smaller) 
                    which is served as a buffer for a sound. You can soldering 
                    it on your own and even use a jack adapter which gives you 
                    all three pins without cutting wires.    
                </p>

                    <!-- investigation of the broken transistors -->
                    <!-- Chinese replacement's get broken -->
                    <!-- Search for a place where music sound goes down -->
                    <!-- found out transistors are not a full replacement or bad -->
                    <!-- junggling transistors to find out the rest of the trace are good -->
                    <!-- replace transistors from more powerful device and solve the issue -->
                    <!-- issue with cables -->
