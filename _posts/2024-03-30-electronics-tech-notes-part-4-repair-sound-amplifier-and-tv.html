        <h1>Executive summary</h1>
        <p>
            Passed week I have been working on repairing eight more electronic 
            devices and generated for business ~5 000 rubles and much more for 
            our clients including securing investments in organic assets which 
            heavily rely on stable work of electronics which had got broken. <br><br>

            This publication shares some interesting things about how to fix 
            your car's sound amplifier and TV at your home. 
        </p>
        <h1>Cases</h1>
        <p>
            <h2>Sounds amplifier</h2>
            <p>
                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <p>
                    <p align="center">
                        <img src="/blog/assets/images/2024-03-30/sound-amplifier.png" width="100%"/>
                    </p> <br><br>

                    By changing amplitude and frequency of an electrical signal 
                    transmitter encode a sound into a plain electrical signal 
                    which is recognized and decoded back to the sound by a 
                    receiver. <br><br>
                    
                    What sounds amplifier does is increase a power of this 
                    electrical signal. Often transformers are used to increase 
                    a power of an electrical signal as it was <a href="https://gelassen.github.io/blog/2023/12/23/electronics-tech-notes-part-1-getting-started.html">described here</a>, 
                    but they create a lot of noise which drastically impact a 
                    sound wave, so something else should be used. <br><br>

                    Transmitters are used for this aim. They also increase a 
                    power of an electricity, but don't have such drawbacks as 
                    transformers. This circuit has several powerful ones which 
                    are served for this aim and has a lot of smaller ones which 
                    intention is not fully clear for me (likely they are used 
                    for setting up base voltage for the rest of the circuit). <br><br>
                    
                    This sound amplifier supports four audio dynamics, this 
                    circuit has many symmetrical elements to do the same work 
                    for each of four dynamics. 
                </p>
                <h3>An instrument to simplify diagnostics</h3>
                <p>
                    Diagnostics of such circuit could be complicated as there 
                    are ~100 elements, most of them could be in one of three 
                    states in the normal mode. In this context you have to check 
                    abnormal voltage drops one each segment of this circuit. <br><br>
                    
                    Fortunately there is another way suggested by my colleague. <br><br>

                    The electrical signal in circuit carrier a sound. It means 
                    connecting something which is able to decode an electrical 
                    signal back to the sound will help up distinguish by ear a 
                    sound from a noise. <br><br>

                    The instrument is old cheap headphones and a probe 
                    connected together over capacitors (0.5 mF or smaller) 
                    which is served as a buffer for a sound. You can soldering 
                    it on your own and even use a jack adapter which gives you 
                    all three pins without cutting wires.    
                </p>
                <h3>The issue and a solution</h3>
                <p>
                    Client complained a sound on one of four dynamics is 
                    disappeared. <br><br>

                    Visual overview didn't give us a clue. The next step was 
                    checking key elements of the circuit. A couple of 
                    transistors shown signal which was different from expected. 
                    Replacement of this transistors should fix the issue. <br><br>
                    
                    However when new transistors had arrived from China and got 
                    replaced, the issue was still there. Moreover they had been 
                    overheated and got broken after the first launch. Usually it 
                    means the issue is also somewhere else further in the circuit. <br><br>

                    That is where our handmade probe was useful. Going through 
                    the circuit with it didn't give much results. Origin 
                    transistors from a different channel were used after this 
                    to check if this segment of the circuit is valid or not. <br><br>

                    The replacement shown the sound is here! It means our 
                    circuit is fine and the issue is in defective transistors. 
                    It is quite surprising, because by working with electronics 
                    you are usually faced with broken circuit, sometimes circuit 
                    design issues or device firmware, but not with just 
                    ordered electronic elements from a factory! Chinese can do 
                    quality products, I have a Lenovo laptop which has been 
                    working for me 8+ years, but quality control to sort out defective 
                    products is a known issue for many purchasers in China. (it is also worth 
                    to note Chinese electronic products often lack of some 
                    elements defined on PCB, but replaced by jumpers in reality, 
                    they might work without it, but becomes less reliable) <br><br> 

                    Transistors from another much more powerful device were 
                    used instead. When they had been put on place, sound was 
                    appear\ed. However a final test with one more sound dynamic 
                    shown there is the device was turned down in some places 
                    of music playing. The investigation shown there was not 
                    enough power, replacement of wires from a power supply had 
                    solved the issue. Another thing to think about when work 
                    with electronics.

                <h3>How does it work?</h3>

                    Design of LED TVs is a much more sophisticated topic to cover. 
                    A good general overview could be found <a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/learn/lcd-vs-led-vs-plasma/how-they-work">here</a>. 
                    The issue with a TV could be in the circuit or firmware where 
                    second one is usually more difficult to investigate and repair. <br><br>
                    
                    Repairing TV is the most lucrative niche among the rest electronic 
                    devices and at the same time is considered as an one of the most 
                    complex, not only because of complexity firmware issues, but 
                    also fragility of the matrix which is easily can be broken. <br><br>
                    
                    I will go in more details about design of TV in future publications 
                    which would be focused on specific part related to the concrete issue. 
                </p>
                <h3>The issue and a solution</h3>
                <p>
                    Client complained TV started to respond strangely on buttons 
                    presses. <br><br>

                    It is a common issue for TV. The root cause is buttons 
                    itself. Usually producers put the cheapest ones, with time 
                    their contact with the rest of the circuit just stops working. 
                    The less expensive way to fix it is just replace them. <br><br>
                    
                    Meanwhile visual diagnostics shown a couple of capacitors 
                    require a replacement. Also the rest of capacitors used as 
                    a signal filters were checked by oscilloscope. In the default 
                    mode they show a smooth line of voltage. However a few of 
                    them shown a sawtooth signal. It means with time they stopped 
                    work properly, without proper work of such filter they 
                    quality of the image will suffer. If you notice change in the 
                    image quality, likely it is a time to replace some of 
                    capacitors in your TV.
