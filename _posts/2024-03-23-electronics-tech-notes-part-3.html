        <h3>Executive summary</h3>
        <p>
            Passed week I have been working on repairing electronics of 
            household appliances. I repaired 4 items which generated ~7000 
            rubles for a business and saved ~25000 rubles for our clients. <br><br>
            
            Meanwhile I learned about how this household appliances are 
            designed and work and what are their typical issues are. The 
            publication is about this. <br><br> 

            The cost of the service is calculated near 10%-20% to make it 
            attractive to both client and business. 
        </p>
        <h3>The cost calculation</h3>
        <p>
            Worth to note a few things about the cost calculation. <br><br>
            
            Seven years ago I already <a href="https://gelassen.github.io/blog/2017/04/25/how-I-learn-how-to-sell-my-and-my-team-services.html">published</a> 
            we have to focus on RoI when do sales of our products or services, 
            <a href="https://gelassen.github.io/blog/2023/11/22/why-do-you-need-to-setup-ssdlc.html">another publication</a> 
            shown how much business is ready to pay to mitigate potential 
            losses caused by a breach in their information security. <br><br> 
            
            The same approach is relevant here, the cost of the service is ~10%-20% of 
            the cost of a new product, except relatively cheap devices which 
            diagnostics and repair work cost nearly the same as the cost of a 
            new device.

        <h3>Cases</h3>
        <p>
            <h4>Microwave owen</h4>
            <p>
                <h5>How does it work?</h5>
                <p>

                        <img src="/blog/assets/images/2024-03-23/microwave-oven-design.jpeg" width="75%" height="33%"/>
                    </p> <br><br>

                    The image above shows a simplified design of a microwave oven. 
                    It has a big capacitor to provide stable current and smooth 
                    it, a big diode to rectify a current, a transformer to increase 
                    voltage and a magnetron which transforms electricity into 
                    microwaves which heat your food. Signals from user interface 
                    are handled by a special control board <br><br>

                    This particular microwave oven has a filter and a fuse at 
                    the beginning of a circuit smooth out noise and preserve 
                    the remaining elements of the circuit in the event of an 
                    electrical breakdown. <br><br>

                    A microwave oven is a bit more sophisticated machine, but 
                    this general overview is enough to understand how it works. <br><br>

                    <p align="center">
                        <img src="/blog/assets/images/2024-03-23/microwave-oven-simplified-circuit.jpeg" width="75%" height="33%"/>
                    </p> 
                </p>
                <h5>The issue and a solution</h5>
                <p>
                    The client complained it doesn't work. Primary diagnostics hadn't 
                    shown issues with key components of the circuit. It was a 
                    time to look at secondary components. <br><br>
                    
                    The issue was in one of the switches, you might see them as 
                    keys on the simplified circuit scheme above. Each oven has 
                    several of them (2 or 3) and they are used to open the 
                    electrical circuit if you open a door to prevent dangerous 
                    magnetron radiation into you. <br><br>

                    <p align="center">
                        <img src="/blog/assets/images/2024-03-23/microwave-oven-switches.jpeg" width="33%" height="33%"/>
                    </p> <br><br>

                    The only one switch didn't work as it should be, but all 
                    three were replaced to make sure a client would not bring 
                    it again in a few months because of another switch breaks 
                    up. When it was done, oven started work as an expected.  
                </p>
            </p>
            <h4>Multicooker</h4>
            <p>
                <h5>How does it work?</h5>
                <p>
                    A multicooker has a heating element, a power supply, 
                    a couple of thermosensors and a control board. <br><br>

                    Thermosensors change their resistance based on temperature. 
                    The variation of the voltage gives a feedback to the control 
                    board how to adjust power of the heating element. Sensors 
                    are located on the top and on the bottom of the multicooker 
                    to make sure the most correct measurements of the 
                    temperature. 
                </p>
                <h5>The issue and a solution</h5>
                <p>
                    The client complained it stopped to turn on. 
                    Diagnostics shown there was a broken wire to the top 
                    thermosensor. After find a replacement and soldering it 
                    back to the thermosensor and the control board, device 
                    started function correctly. 
                </p>
            </p>
            <h4>Juicer</h4>
            <p>
                <h5>How does it work?</h5>
                <p>
                    The most electronic devices I has repaired so far has two 
                    basic components -- a power board and a control board. 
                    The power board of this device is shown below. <br><br>
                    
                    <p align="center">
                        <img src="/blog/assets/images/2024-03-23/juicer-power-board.jpeg" width="75%" height="33%"/>
                    </p> <br><br>

                    This and many similar power boards works on principle
                    described in <a href="https://gelassen.github.io/blog/2023-12-23/electronics-tech-notes-part-1-getting-started.html">this my publication</a> <br><br>

                    Worth to note this juicer has a mechanical lever which is 
                    pressed only when all parts are assembled together. In 
                    others cases, it the circuit will be turned off.  
                </p>
                <h5>The issue and a solution</h5>
                <p>
                    The client complained it stopped to work. Diagnostics 
                    shown obvious signs of a broken resistor which regulates a 
                    power voltage. After it was replaced device still didn't 
                    work. Further investigation and tracing the circuit shown 
                    there was another resistor which became broken. When it 
                    had been replaced, the device starts working.    
                </p>
            </p>
            <h4>Thermopot</h4>
            <p>
                <h5>How does it work?</h5>
                <p>
                    <p align="center">
                        <img src="/blog/assets/images/2024-03-23/thermopot.jpeg" width="75%" height="33%"/>
                    </p> <br><br>

                    The heating element, classics power and control boards, a pumping engine, a 
                    thermosensor and a thermofuse are main components of this 
                    device. <br><br>
                    
                    The power board has some elements of a control board, 
                    I never reached the control board near a control panel, 
                    so actually I don't have information on this wires goes from 
                    the control board or directly from buttons on the control 
                    panel.<br><br>
                    
                    The control board sends electric signals and either heating 
                    element or a pumping engine starts work.  
                </p>
                <h5>The issue and a solution</h5>
                <p>
                    The client complained it stopped work. Diagnostics shown 
                    flooded pumping engine, however after replacement device 
                    still wasn't working. Further investigation shown a broken 
                    stabilitron (Zenner's diode) and an a diode. When they had 
                    been replaced, device starts working.  
                </p>
