        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
            This is a fourth part of the seria of publications regarding work on 
            <a href="https://github.com/Gelassen/swap">the Swap project</a>. 
            It covers a scope of work on setting up Continues Integration (CI), 
            integrating tests as a part of CI and automation of an Ethereum 
            private chain deployment.
        </p>
        <h3>Continues Integration (CI)</h3>
        <p>
            The project is hosted in the public github repository. Github team 
            makes a good job to evolve towards a complete workspace beyond its 
            initial codebase cloud repository. Several years ago they 
            introduced Github Actions as their CI tool. When demand in CI for 
            project became a vital task, it was obvious to enable Github 
            Actions CI as a native for this platform solution <br><br>   
            
            The configuration script is available below: <br><br>

                    pull_request:

            What this script does is install an essential software, setting up 
            test database, runs all tests and prepare test reports. <br><br>

            I am not satisfied with this solution. Due further work I faced with 
            some bizzare issues which I haven't resolved yet in a to give always 
            correct feedback on codebase integrity. I will touch this issues in 
            the next sections, but thinking & discussing possible mitigation steps to 
            overcome such issues in this or another CI tool I agreed on the best 
            solution is to make all this CI automation within a bash script to split up 
            valuable automation logic from CI's specific implementation. A known 
            drawback is it will disable us from using some important CI's 
            features such as caching.    
        </p>
        <h3>Test automation</h3>
        <p>
            At this moment server API tests, smart contracts tests and mobile 
            client tests have been written already, but the task is to make 
            them run on each commit to the repository to confirm commit does 
            not break anything. <br><br>

            Tasks of CI responsible for setting up test environment and execute 
            tests on each commit are shared above. <br><br>

            Similar to the case of <a href="https://github.com/Gelassen/government-rus">government-rus</a> 
            tests passes locally, but on the server one test has been failing 
            which marks CI run as unsuccessful. The root cause of this is 
            unclear. Build reports created at the end of the build work as 2nd 
            source of confidence as a workaround of this issue. <br><br>

            Running Android UI tests requires support of KVM which is rarely 
            provided by cloud CI providers. In case of Github Actions 
            macos-latest and self-hosted runners are only possible solutions. <br><br>

            Running in cloud on macos-latest almost always ends up with failed 
            build, caused by 1-3 tests have been failed. Despite on run the 
            same tests locally are successfully executed. <br><br>

            Setting up a whole flow on another machine with help of self-hosted 
            runner faced with extra issues of additional configurations. With 
            increasing demand this option should be explored further. Some 
            extra thoughts on this and similar topics 
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59241249/how-to-run-github-actions-workflows-locally">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59241249/how-to-run-github-actions-workflows-locally</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Backend startup and extracting keys automation</h3>
        <p>
            The npm package manager which stays back of NodeJs and the rest JS 
            based technologies supports <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/scripts">custom scripts</a>. 
            You have to write such script and later invoke it from the CI. <br><br>

            This are my scripts to launch server under different environments: <br><br>
            <pre>
                "scripts": {
                    "start": "NODE_ENV=development node app.js",
                    "start:prod": "NODE_ENV=production node app.js",
                    "start:test": "NODE_ENV=test node app.js",
                    "test": "NODE_ENV=test jest --forceExit --detectOpenHandles",
                    // the rest scripts
                }
            </pre> <br><br>

            Npm's community provides <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/config">Node-config</a> 
            to create and support multiple environment configurations. Web 
            ports, databases configs, urls, credentials - all goes there. <br><br>

            One extra script for blockchain was implemented too. Each account 
            on the Ethereum chain has corresponding private keys. When account 
            has been created, we get its keys in the encoded form. For contract 
            deployment we will need this key decoded. <a href="https://github.com/ethereumjs/keythereum">Keythereum</a> 
            looks like the best option to do this, script which exploits 
            keythereum was implemented and added as a npm script.    
        </p>
        <h3>Private chain deployment automation</h3>
        <p>
            In previous publications I shared reasons why I have to migrate to 
            ethereum personal private chain. In short, it is not only speed up 
            the development, but also become an essential way to utilise 
            ethereum chain as a part of this project. <br><br>

            Currently, due development stage, a private chain is hosted on the 
            virtual machine deployed on my personal computer. Despite on the VM has 
            a hibernate mode, it still needs to be restarted and the chain 
            deployment should be done again. That's why I decided to automate 
            it. <br><br>

            On the chain start we will have to tell each node others nodes 
            addresses, etherbase accounts and start mining. My initial script 
            which partly automate this is shared below: <br><br>

            <pre>
                # !/bin/bash

                export pwd="<your password>"

                export NODE1_PORT=2001
                export NODE1_PORT_UDP_TCP=30304
                export NODE1_PORT_RPC=8552

                export NODE2_PORT=2002
                export NODE2_PORT_UDP_TCP=30305
                export NODE2_PORT_RPC=8553

                export NODE3_PORT=2003
                export NODE3_PORT_UDP_TCP=30306
                export NODE3_PORT_RPC=8554

                export NODE_IP=127.0.0.1

                echo "Run existing geth nodes. Please make sure they has been create & configured first!"

                if ! command -v geth &> /dev/null
                then 
                    echo "geth command could not be found"
                    exit
                else 
                    echo "geth has been found. continue shell script"
                fi

                # nodes should be run over http to allow curl interactiion for add peer automation

                geth --allow-insecure-unlock --http --http.addr "0.0.0.0" --port $NODE1_PORT_UDP_TCP --http.corsdomain '*' --authrpc.port $NODE1_PORT_RPC --http.port $NODE1_PORT --http.api admin,personal,eth,net,web3  --datadir ./node1/data --miner.gasprice 1 --verbosity 3 &

                echo "Install jq"

                # sudo apt-get install jq -y $p

                sudo apt-get install jq -y "${pwd}"

                echo "Get enode info and add peers to each node"

                node1_enode_result=$(curl -X GET http://$NODE_IP:$NODE1_PORT -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id": 1,  "method":"admin_nodeInfo"}' | jq -r '.result.enode')

                IFS="@" read -r node1_enode_id node1_end_point <<< "$node1_enode_result"

                echo "$node1_enode_id"

                node2_enode_result=$(curl -X GET http://$NODE_IP:$NODE2_PORT -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id": 1,  "method":"admin_nodeInfo"}' | jq -r '.result.enode')

                IFS="@" read -r node2_enode_id node2_end_point <<< "$node2_enode_result"

                echo "$node2_enode_id"

                node3_enode_result=$(curl -X GET http://$NODE_IP:$NODE3_PORT -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id": 1,  "method":"admin_nodeInfo"}' | jq -r '.result.enode')

                IFS="@" read -r node3_enode_id node3_end_point <<< "$node3_enode_result"

                echo "$node3_enode_id"

                node1_endpoint="${node1_enode_id}@${NODE_IP}:${NODE1_PORT}"

                echo "${node1_endpoint}"

                node2_endpoint="${node2_enode_id}@${NODE_IP}:${NODE2_PORT}"

                echo "${node2_endpoint}"

                node3_endpoint="${node3_enode_id}@${NODE_IP}:${NODE3_PORT}"

                echo "${node3_endpoint}"
            </pre> <br><br>

            This script will give us urls of nodes, code which tells nodes 
            this urls is: <br><br>
            
            <pre>
                curl -X POST http://$NODE_IP:$NODE2_PORT -H "Content-Type:application/json" --data "{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method":"admin_addPeer", "id":1, "params":["$node1_endpoint"]}"
            </pre> <br><br>

            , but this code has been disabled because of issue with getting 
            response from the server and the lack of actual peers despite on 
            a positive server response when command has been executed via 
            console. <br><br>

            Recently the Geth team <a href="https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/private-network">published documentation</a> 
            how to deploy a private chain. For node configuration they uses a 
            bootnode and in the secure way unlock accounts for start. This week 
            I tried their end-to-end example, it was designed for Clique 
            consensus algorithm. Unfortunately, despite on benefits of the 
            Clique for a private network, it has issues and 
            <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/18402">some severe</a> 
            of them are still open. At this moment the Clique is not a option 
            to go further. <br><br>

            Applying the same example for the Ethash consensus algorithm gives 
            me another issue. I am not able to pass passwords from a separate 
            file. Consequently it makes bootnode not useful here and 
            --allow-insecure-unlock is still necessary, despite on it is a hack
