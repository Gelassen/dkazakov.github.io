        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <div>
            This is a third publication in series of building forecast sales 
            system for an airline. It covers organization and management 
            challenges have been appearing in this project and solutions to 
            solve them.  
        </div>
        <h3>Executive summary</h3>
        <div>
            Current team experience challenges during growth of new tasks which 
            brings overhead on management and developers team. That's lead to set 
            of unhealthy symptoms of development process which should be fixed 
            to avoid future issues in the software delivery. <br><br> 

            At first, the classic set of scrum methods was offered to fix silo of 
            project knowledge: <br> 
            - formalization of requirements by tickets in CRM with user stories in 
            the kanban style <br>
            - daily stand-ups in chat by sharing what each team manger did, 
            planning to do and blockers on his or her way <br>
            - meeting minutes after calls to track agreements, action points and 
            responsible persons <br><br>

            At second, the set of measures were introduced to stabilize codebase 
            and make sure we always have a stable version of the project ready to 
            deploy for the client: <br> 
            - setup and keep up-to-date README file with all steps to deploy and 
            run the project <br>
            - close the master branch for writing and push all work via Pull 
            Requests after code review working by GitFlow in separate branches <br> 
            - set-up Continues Integration to compile project and run automate 
            tests to confirm stability of the project in the automated way 
            (still in backlog) <br><br> 

            Organizational flaws were offered to solve by following set of measures: <br> 
            - fix changes in requirements and scope of the project within a 
            sprint to let the team focus on task and deliver it <br>
            - setting up relationships with the both two key stakeholders and gather 
            feedback on a regular basis <br>
            - formalize all requests from the client in tickets to confirm we are all 
            on the same page <br>
            - regular rotation of team members over projects tasks to mitigate 
            silos of knowledge and cope with a bus factor <br><br>
            
            Similar to our bodies which are experienced constant exposure to 
            viruses and others threats to our health, our projects are 
            constantly faced with changes and challenges. <br> 
            Similar to like healthy person could pass through this without 
            much issues, but a person with broken or suppressed immune system 
            get ill, our projects pass through all challenges when everything 
            is organized right and get bad when something within is going wrong. <br>
            That's why it is important to setup the right set of measures in 
            management and development work since the beginning and evolve it 
            with time when a new challenges have come.      
        </div>
        <h3>Transmitting knowledge when scale up the team</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Issue</h4>
            <div>
                - the most of the knowledge within team members heads (knowledge silos) <br>
                - specification doesn't cover recent key decisions <br>
                - no road map <br>
                - no a regular update on what is going within a project <br>
                - lack of formalized relevant requirements <br>
            </div>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <div>
                - formalize knowledge into the specification or tickets <br>
                - map specification into epic tickets that brings road map, hierarchy 
                and structure into work planning <br>
                - schedule and perform daily meetings in the way what was done 
                yesterday, which task would be taken today, what kind of 
                blockers each team member has right now <br>
                - new request from client should be tracked by ticket which 
                should be put in the backlog with the future prioritization   
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Miscommunication with a client</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Issue</h4>
            <div>
                - the client insist on one thing referring to the past when a 
                vendor refers to another thing
            </div>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <div>
                - all calls and meetings in person should be followed-up by a 
                protocol (aka meeting minutes) decisions, actions points and 
                responsible parties should be tracked and emphasized. This 
                protocol become an official agreement if there is no one added 
                corrections and adjustments afterwards   <br>
                - result of delivered feature should be shown up to the client 
                on a regular basis to gather feedback <br> 
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>There is no track of the recently made decisions</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Issue</h4>
            <div>
                - passed meetings leaves vague outcomes in the heads of parties <br>
                - difficulties to refer to reached in the past agreements <br>
            </div>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <div>
                Similar to the previous point: <br>
                - all calls and meetings in person should be followed-up by a 
                protocol (aka meeting minutes) decisions, actions points and 
                responsible parties should be tracked and emphasized. This 
                protocol become an official agreement if there is no one added 
                corrections and adjustments afterwards   <br>
                - result of delivered feature should be shown up to the client 
                on a regular basis to gather feedback <br> 
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>No clear plan on what we deliver and when</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Issue</h4>
            <div>
                - a whole project looks like a single piece of work which should 
                be tackled <br>
                - split on separate pieces exists, but only over a oral agreement 
                between two initial members of the team <br>
                - change requests and shift in the date of the delivery are not 
                tracked as a consequence 
            </div>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <div>
                - formalize knowledge on the level of tickets <br>
                - map specification to tickets; it might look as a set of epic 
                tasks which are later separated on much smaller pieces of work 
                with cross-references on each other <br>
                - carefully listen a client for an each changes request, put it 
                as an user stories and all necessary details into the ticket, 
                put the ticket in the bottom of the backlog <br>
                - if client insist to do this right now, communicate with this 
                a shift in the delivery schedule, increasing budget or drop of 
                another functionality to compensate increasing work within scope   
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>No ways to verify we have a currently working software in the repository</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Issue</h4>
            <div>
                - each change in the code, each commit is a potential bug <br>
                - therefore it becomes crucial to verify a compilation and a 
                stable work of the codebase on an each commit <br>
                - lack of such verification is a serious issue
            </div>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <div>
                - setup a Continues Integration \ Continues Deployment (CI\CD) 
                process; it basic version it would compile your code on each 
                commit and can be extended to run automatic jobs including 
                tests and deployment. <br>
                - close a master branch from writing and do all work in branches 
                which are later, by completion, would be merged with the master <br>
                over Pull Requests (PR) and code review with running tests by CI  
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>No clear description how to build and deploy a project</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Issue</h4>
            <div>
                - access to the repo is not enough to compile and deploy the 
                project <br>
                - despite on the project is based on docker which allows to run 
                project within 
                <a href="https://gelassen.github.io/blog/2023/07/22/multicomponent-project-deployment-over-docker.html">one command</a>, 
                you can not really do this in one step because of many optional 
                features, configuration files and shell scripts  
            </div>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <div>
                - for such scenarios a clear and comprehensive README file 
                should be added within repository which describes how to 
                compile and deploy the project <br>
                - potential some extra work could resolve the most of this 
                issues and fully automate the whole process
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Delivery of the project mostly depends on heroism of individual 
            members rather than on set of measures and practices reducing 
            uncertainty and making progress further more stable</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Issue</h4>
            <div>
                - engineers always face with new tasks for them; engineering 
                process often is not a set of steps to complete to get things 
                done, but an invention of a new thing <br>
                - besides engineering challenges organizational and business 
                challenges makes this work even more complicated <br>
                - even if all parties do an excellent work to clarify and 
                write down all requirements and expectations, a few months 
                later business environment will change which will lead to 
                changes in requirements <br>
                - in this way engineering process doesn't look like a factory 
                where you put resources at the start and get result at the end, 
                but an innovation process with multiple iterations where each 
                round brings new requirements to a product and evolve it with 
                time       
            </div>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <div>
                Our ability to deliver a product to a client should not depend 
                solely on the personal heroism of each team member. It should 
                be based on a systematic set of actions, by performing which 
                we will steadily move forward, minimizing known risks. <br>

                One of the issues with this is applying the whole set of the 
                best practices becomes very costly. One american engineering 
                company who do this and with whom I had a chance to work with 
                sell their engineer hour by 250 USD per a team member. <br>
                
                A possible solution for this is to start with minimum set of 
                such practices and gradually extend it to meet a growing 
                complexity of the project by spotting rising issues and choose 
                an appropriate solution for them. <br>
                
                In this way each project would require their own set of 
                measures which makes its unique in terms of organization and 
                management. That's why I warn you to use this set of measures 
                described here as a reference, but not as a ready-to-implement 
                action plan. 
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Stakeholders of the project are not clearly identified and involved in the work with the team</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Issue</h4>
            <div>
                - closer to a final date of the delivery the team get a 
                negative feedback from a client with many change requests <br>
                - the team closely work with one stakeholder, but actual user 
                of the product is a different department <br>
                - there was not a close work with this people during a whole 
                lifecycle of the project, therefore their requirements to a 
                product was not considered and covered   
            </div>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <div>
                - setup communication channel with all key stakeholders <br>
                - regularly show a current version of product and gather 
                feedback; in practices of Agile and Scrum it should be done 
                at the end of each sprint -- once in each two weeks. <br>
                - think about others people who will use this product or 
                whose work would be affected directly and indirectly to gather 
                their requirements and mitigate sabotage of product 
                implementation 
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>A lot of changes in requirements on the fly when deadline and budget are fixed</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Issue</h4>
            <div>
                - new requests come from the client when a budget and a deadline 
                are fixed <br>
                - work on the math module is a true R&D with constant adjustments <br>
                - database schema evolving with years and new requests with 
                impact on a whole project <br>
                - the client is a government company work with whom is specially 
                regulated by a federal law to mitigate risks of corruption which 
                brings restrictions on types of contract we could sign  
            </div>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <div>
                The issue with changing requirements are known and even natural 
                for software development. Even if all parties do an excellent 
                work to clarify and write down all requirements and 
                expectations, a few months later business environment will 
                change which will lead to changes in requirements. <br><br>

                The change in requirements is normal. What is not normal 
                is an attempt to fit such kind of work in the boundaries of 
                not an appropriate contract. <br><br>

                The industry developed set of practices (Agile, Scrum, Lean 
                principles) to meet with such needs. 
                <a href="https://savvycomsoftware.com/blog/common-it-contracts/">Dedicated team or time & materials</a> 
                types of contracts should be used this, but the russian federal 
                doesn't allow this. <br><br>
                
                It might sounds fun, but the lack of experience of working on 
                projects with a corrupted client (the client who used this 
                project to steal money) doesn't allow me to give a proper 
                recommendation how to cope with this. However the following 
                roadmap at the first perspective looks right: <br><br>

                - initiate lobby of a new law which would better fit a nature 
                of software development <br>
                - meanwhile do your best to fit the reality of the custom 
                software development into the existing forms of law regulations <br>
                - do it by iterations where each iteration brings product 
                closer to a final product <br>
                - freeze change in requirements till the end of each 
                iteration with following change of 
                <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/agile-iron-triangle">the scope, budget and deadline</a> <br>
                - build mutually trusted relationships between all involving 
                parties in the software delivery    
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Unexpected illness of the key team member with loss valuable knowledge besides team's velocity</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Issue</h4>
            <div>
                - an one of team members had been injured with hospitalization 
                for a month or even more <br>
                - it caused a loss of a valuable knowledge about the project <br> 
                - it also caused a decrease in the team velocity to deliver new 
                functionality <br>
                - generally it is known as a bus factor
            </div>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <div>
                How would you deliver the project when one or more your team 
                members get crashed under the bus? That's how this risk is 
                formalized in working environments I lived and worked. Answering 
                on this question helps you proactively develop set of steps to 
                mitigate this risks. <br><br>
                
                When you lose a team member by any reason, you don't lose just 
                a worker, you lose unique project and business knowledge this 
                person has together with his technical expertise which takes 
                years to gain and sometimes quite unique, so it become 
                difficult to replace. That's why retaining your talents is even 
                more important rather to find and hire them. However, there 
                are also set of practices who minimize loss from team member 
                temporarily or permanent leave. <br><br>
                
                At first, formalize your knowledge about the product and 
                requirements in a form of specification, tickets with user 
                stories extend by technical requirements, automate tests which 
                are by itself served as a actual requirements to a software. <br><br>
                
                At second, organize your development process in the way to all 
                your code which appears in your master branch pass through code 
                review at least one team member and better a few more. In this 
                way you would foster sharing of the project knowledge with 
                others team members. <br><br>
                
                Finally, consider regular rotations of developers each two days 
                among assigned tasks. It means two days we have been working one 
                feature, after two days we switched with a colleague a tasks 
                with each other, so everyone would know the whole codebase. 
                There would not be a no one assigned to a single feature without 
                much knowledge about the rest of the codebase. The import points 
                are: <br> 
                - tickets should be well prepared and be within epic tickets 
                which define a whole feature of the product <br>
                - engineers at the end of the work day or just before switch 
                should perform a WIP (work-in-progress) commit of all their 
                current work in the repo <br>
                - switch between tasks should be made on different features, 
                there is no much sense to make an exchange of tasks within 
                the same feature. <br><br>

        <h3>Government regulations of work with state companies which don't match well in the way how software projects should be developed and delivered</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>Issue</h4>
            <div>
                - the client is a government company work with whom is specially 
                regulated by a federal law to mitigate risks of corruption which 
                brings restrictions on types of contract we could sign
                - it does match well with a nature of custom software 
                development and has negative impact on our ability to deliver a 
                product
            </div>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <div>
                The issue with changing requirements are known and even natural 
                for software development. Even if all parties do an excellent 
                work to clarify and write down all requirements and 
                expectations, a few months later business environment will 
                change which will lead to changes in requirements. <br><br>

                The change in requirements is normal. What is not normal 
                is an attempt to fit such kind of work in the boundaries of 
                not an appropriate contract. <br><br>

                I already shared earlier my view on a possible solution, but I 
                would repeat it here in a separate paragraph to emphasize the 
                importance of this -- it looks as a root cause of many troubles 
                this projects faces. <br><br>

                The industry developed set of practices (Agile, Scrum, Lean 
                principles) to meet with such needs. 
                <a href="https://savvycomsoftware.com/blog/common-it-contracts/">Dedicated team or time & materials</a> 
                types of contracts should be used this, but the russian federal 
                doesn't allow this. <br><br>
                
                It might sounds fun, but the lack of experience of working on 
                projects with a corrupted client (the client who used this 
                project to steal money) doesn't allow me to give a proper 
                recommendation how to cope with this. However the following 
                roadmap at the first perspective looks right: <br><br>

                - initiate lobby of a new law which would better fit a nature 
                of software development <br>
                - meanwhile do your best to fit the reality of the custom 
                software development into the existing forms of law regulations <br>
                - do it by iterations where each iteration brings product 
                closer to a final product <br>
                - freeze change in requirements till the end of each 
                iteration with following change of 
                <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/agile-iron-triangle">the scope, budget and deadline</a> <br>
                - build mutually trusted relationships between all involving 
                parties in the software delivery
