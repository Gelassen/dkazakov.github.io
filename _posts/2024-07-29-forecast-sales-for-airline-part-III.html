        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <div>
            This is a third publication in the seria of building forecast sales 
            system for an airline. It covers organisation and management 
            challenges have been appearing in this project and solutions to 
            solve them.  
        </div>
        <h3>Executive summary</h3>
        <div>
            Current team experience challenges during growth of new tasks which 
            brings overhead on management and developers team. That's lead to set 
            of unhealthy symptoms of development process which should be fixed 
            to avoid future issues in the software delivery. <br><br> 

            At first, the classic set of scrum methods was offered to fix silo of 
            project knowledge: <br> 
            - formalisation of requirements by tickets in CRM with user stories in 
            the kanban style <br>
            - daily stand-ups in chat by sharing what each team manger did, 
            planning to do and blockers on his or her way <br>
            - meeting minutes after calls to track agreements, action points and 
            responsible persons <br><br>

            At second, the set of measures were introduced to stabilise codebase 
            and make sure we always have a stable version of the project ready to 
            deploy for the client: <br> 
            - setup and keep up-to-date README file with all steps to deploy and 
            run the project <br>
            - close the master branch for writing and push all work via Pull 
            Requests after code review working by gitflow in separate branches <br> 
            - set-up Continues Integration to compile project and run automate 
            tests to confirm stability of the project in the automated way 
            (still in backlog) <br><br> 

            Organisational flaws were offered to solve by following set of measures: <br> 
            - fix changes in requirements and scope of the project within a 
            sprint to let the team focus on task and deliver it <br>
            - setting up relationships with the both two key stakeholders and gather 
            feedback on a regular basis <br>
            - formalize all requests from the client in tickets to confirm we are all 
            on the same page <br>
            - regular rotation of team members over projects tasks to mitigate 
            silos of knowledge and cope with a bus factor <br><br>
            
            Similar to our bodies which are experienced constant exposure to 
            viruses and others threats to our health, our projects are 
            constantly faced with changes and challenges. <br> 
            Similar to like healthy person could pass through this without 
            much issues, but a person with broken or suppressed immune system 
            get ill, our projects pass through all challenges when everything 
            is organised right and get bad when something within is going wrong. <br>
            That's why it is important to setup the right set of measures in 
            management and development work since the beginning and evolve it 
            with time when a new challenges have come.

                - the most of the knowledge within team members heads
                - specification doesn't cover recent key decisions
                - no road map
                - no a regular update on what is going within a project
                - lack of formalised relevant requirements

            <h4>Issue</h4>
            <div>
                - the client insist on one thing referring to the past when a vendor refers to another thing

            <h4>Issue</h4>
            <div>
                There is no track of the recently made decisions

            <div>
                No clear plan on what we deliver and when
                - a whole project looks like a single piece of work which should be tackled 
                - split on separate pieces exists, but only over a oral agreement between two initial members of the team
                - change requests and shift in the date of delivery are not tracked as a consequence 
            </div>
