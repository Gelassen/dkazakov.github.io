        <h3>Executive summary</h3>
        <p>
            Passed three weeks I have been working on repairing electronics of 
            household appliances. I repaired 14 items which generated ~28000 
            rubles for a business and saved ~110 000 rubles for our clients. <br><br>
            
            This publication covers work on two interesting cases - custom assembly 
            of automation for pressure gauge and replacement of the touch panel 
            for microwave oven.

        <h3>Cases</h3>

            <h4>Automation for pressure gauge</h4>
            <p>

                A client had a request to build automation for his compressor 
                instead of old one. He brought us his own components: forty years 
                old soviet russian pressure gauge, two relays and several wires. <br><br>
                
                The circuit scheme is partly available on the photo above. <br><br>
                
                The arrow in the gauge is moved by a gas pressure in the reservoir. 
                When it reaches a minimal pressure, it gives a first signal by breaking 
                a current flow in the one of three wires. When it reaches the 
                maximum pressure, it breaks the current flow in the second wire. 
                At this stage there is no more current in the circuit and connected engine 
                which work increases the gas pressure stops working. When 
                decreasing pressure moves arrow to the minimal state, circuit 
                becomes connected again, current start flow and new cycle begins. <br><br>
                
                This automation could be implemented by two relays -- by one 
                relay on minimal and maximum pressure state. Pressure state in 
                the circuit could be either shorted or disconnected, so two states 
                for each position means four different states in total should 
                implemented in the circuit. Relays perfectly fit this aim, because 
                they could be either in the state of providing current or 
                disabling current flow with several pins to represent its state 
                for peripherals. <br><br>
                
                The wire which represent minimal gas indicator should be 
                connected with a pin which represent 1st relay power supply. 
                Pins which are shorted when power is supplied should be 
                connected with a contactor which does or does not provide 
                current to the pressure engine depends on current on its 
                inductive coil. <br><br>

                The wire which represents maximum gas indicator should goes to 
                a power supply pin of the 2nd relay. A wire from a pin which 
                is shorted under power supply presence should be connected with 
                a contactor's inductive coil. <br><br>  
                
                In such configuration between minimal and maximum gas states a 
                circuit is disconnected, therefore there is no power supply 
                provided to the engine. To mitigate this issue contactor is 
                shunted by providing connection from 2nd relay pin which is 
                shorted when there is no power supplied to the relay. <br><br>

                There is no electronics, just electrics, but I think it might 
                be interested for my clients and readers, because some 
                software engineering work requires to build special apparats 
                which is later programmed.

            <h4>Handmade replacement of the touch panel</h4>
            <p>
                A client complained the microwave oven stops to respond on press 
                of touch panel. <br><br>
                
                Further investigation shown a cable to the board had some broken 
                contacts due erosion and oxidation. Soldering would not help 
                here, because this contacts are made by spraying metal 
                particles to the silicone surface. Usually you have to buy a 
                new cable for replacement, but this days you could not find it 
                on the market. <br><br>  

                Handmade replacement of the touch panel is the next option. 
                Small buttons were used to replace the touch panel and glued to 
                the board. The next step was tediously soldering small wires 
                taken from a transformer (they are varnished for insulation) to 
                each button and interconnected with each other according to a 
                circuit reverse engineered from the original cable. The end 
                parts of this wires were soldering directly to the main board. <br><br>

                </p> <br><br>
                
                After assembling it back test launches shown it works well and 
                the microwave became ready to be sent back to the client.
