        <h1>Executive summary</h1>
        <p>
            Passed week I have been working on repairing eight more electronic 
            devices and generated for business ~5 000 rubles and much more for 
            our clients including securing investements in organic assets which 
            heavyly rely on stable work of electronics which had got broken. <br><br>

            This publication shares some interesting things about how to fix 
            your car's sound amplifier and TV at your home.

            <h2>Sounds amplifier</h2>
            <p>
                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <p>
                    <!-- how does it work -->
                    <!-- describe how build an instrument to trace a sound in circuit -->
                </p>
                <h3>The issue and a solution</h3>
                <p>
                    <!-- ivestigation of the broken transistors -->
                    <!-- Chinese replacement's get broken -->
                    <!-- Search for a place where music sound goes down -->
                    <!-- found out transistors are not a full replacement or bad -->
                    <!-- jungling transistors to find out the rest of the trace are good -->
                    <!-- replace transistors from more powerfull device and solve the issue -->
                    <!-- issue with cables -->
                </p>

                <h3>The issue and a solution</h3>
                <p>
                    <!-- visual diagnostics and capacitors replacement -->
                    <!-- change buttons which regulates drop in voltage to sovle buttons issue -->
                    <!-- ivestigate signal on capacitors to find out bad ones which causes artifacts on display  -->
