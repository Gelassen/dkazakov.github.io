            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
                Passed week I had been asked several times about my recommendation on how 
                to become a software developer. I had shared my thoughts on this and think 
                it would be valuable to share them here as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                My professional background covers 5 years of specialized education in the 
                university (standard amount of years to get a higher education in Russia) 
                and 15+ years of work with startups, outsourcing, consulting and product 
                companies and running my own business in Russia and abroad in the 
                international environment.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The original posts had been intended to a fresher in the computer science 
                faculty, but I think it could be applied to a wider audience who are also 
                want to become a software developer.

            <h3>The roadmap</h3>
            <p>
                Often simple action wins over an overthink strategy on how to reach the 
                goal. So the first recommendation would be to simply do something and learn 
                from a result to adopt and do next steps more clever.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I would like to recommend you this book to read before your graduation <br><br>

                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670">Code Complete by Steve McConnell</a> <br><br>

                It is very valuable about general programming. May be it worth to read it 
                twice - one during your studies, another one after you get an one year of working 
                experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then I want to recommend you to read this my publication <br><br>

                <a href="https://gelassen.github.io/blog/2021/02/27/broad-vs-narrow-specialisation.html">Broad vs Narrow specialisation</a> <br><br>

                It will make some things clearer for you. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Also I would suggest this one <br><br>

                <a href="https://gelassen.github.io/blog/2024/06/23/the-modern-education-and-place-of-ai-here.html">The modern education and place of AI here</a> <br><br>

                It should help you in your studies
            </p>
            <p>
                
                <br><br>
                Which programming language should you choose? <br><br>
                <br><br>

                All of this languages are just instruments. You have to learn them to 
                solve a task at front of you. <br><br>

                At first it would be good to specialise in the one field to master it 
                deep enough, but later it will be good to broaden your skills and 
                expertise. <br><br>

                You should focus on the fields which has big market share and good 
                capacity for growth. You should analyse market for this. <br><br> 

                However, it is possible life brings you opportunities which are 
                different from your plans. Often this is a God providence regarding 
                your life. Seriously consider them too.
            </p>
            <p>
                You need near 10 000 hours of practice to master the chosen field. 
                So it will take near 5 years to become a professional. <br><br>

                However, the quality of this hours and years also matters. Generally 
                speaking, if at your place you feel you don't grow professionally, 
                then likely you are at the wrong place and you should move further.

                At <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a> you can prepare 
                your general programming skills. <br><br>

                If you are interested in data science, you can go to 
                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">kaggle</a> and solve the challenges 
                there.

                If you are interested in cyber security, you can train yourself in 
                penetration testing on this platforms <br><br>

            <p>
                Your main issue is you barely know anything about the life and work. 
                Unfortunately, academic environment lacks this information as well. <br><br> 

                The best thing for you is to find out real engineering job or open 
                source project. If you face with requirements you don't meet, then 
                just develop necessary skills in your free time. <br><br>

                Ask your teachers is there any project you can contribute to? 
                <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google summer of code</a> 
                is also a good place to chose a good project to work on and horn your skills. <br><br>

                Otherwise, I would start with hacker rank task first until you feel 
                comfortable with easiest tasks they offer. <br><br> 

                After it go to the kaggle to practice data science tasks.
